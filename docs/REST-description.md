# Representational State Transfer (REST)

Principles of REST
- Resources expose easily understood directory structure URIs.
- Representations transfer JSON or XML to represent data objects and attributes.
- Messages use HTTP methods explicitly (for example, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
- Stateless interactions store no client context on the server between requests. State dependencies limit and restrict scalability. The client holds session state.
